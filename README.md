## Getting Started

To use this program, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ismat-samadov/fibonacci.git
   ```

2. Compile the C code using a C compiler. For example:

   ```bash
   gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci
   ```

## Usage

Run the compiled program and follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of terms for the Fibonacci sequence.

```bash
./fibonacci
```

The program will then display the generated Fibonacci sequence.

## Input Validation

The program validates user input to ensure that a positive integer is entered for the number of terms. If the input is not a positive integer, an error message will be displayed.
